Integration Steps with the UI:
Replace target_words with the UI's actual target words.
Modify the submit_guess method to call solver.solve() and feed guesses to the UI.
Use the get_feedback method to update the CSP constraints based on UI feedback.
This approach ensures the CSP solver dynamically interacts with the game to find valid solutions.
