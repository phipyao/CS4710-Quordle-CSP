Integration Steps with the UI:
Replace target_words with the UI's actual target words.
Modify the submit_guess method to call solver.solve() and feed guesses to the UI.
Use the get_feedback method to update the CSP constraints based on UI feedback.
This approach ensures the CSP solver dynamically interacts with the game to find valid solutions.

NEED TO FIX THIS PROBLEM:
The error ValueError: Inconsistent lengths: value='snoke' (5), feedback=[...] (10) occurs because the length of the feedback list (10 in this case) does not match the length of the value string (snoke, which has 5 characters). This suggests that the feedback being passed to the is_consistent method is malformed.

Root Cause
The feedback list appears to include multiple rounds of feedback concatenated together, rather than just the feedback for the current word being evaluated.

From the error:

feedback is 10 elements long, which suggests it contains feedback from multiple guesses or frames.
The function expects feedback for a single word (e.g., a 5-character word like snoke should have feedback of length 5).
This likely stems from how self.feedback is being updated or how feedback is passed to is_consistent.

Debugging Steps
Inspect self.feedback in enforce_arc_consistency Print the self.feedback[y] just before it is passed to is_consistent:

python
Copy code
def enforce_arc_consistency(self):
    ...
    for word in set(self.domains[x]):
        print(f"DEBUG: Feedback for {y}: {self.feedback[y]}")
        if not any(self.is_consistent(y, other_word, self.feedback[y]) for other_word in self.domains[y]):
            self.domains[x].remove(word)
            revised = True
    ...
This will show whether self.feedback[y] contains concatenated feedback or some other unexpected structure.

Inspect Feedback Updates in update_constraints Check if feedback is being appended incorrectly in update_constraints:

python
Copy code
def update_constraints(self, feedback):
    print(f"DEBUG: Feedback received for update_constraints: {feedback}")
    for var, word_feedback in zip(self.variables, feedback):
        # Ensure feedback is being stored correctly
        self.feedback[var].append(word_feedback)
        print(f"DEBUG: Updated feedback for {var}: {self.feedback[var]}")
This will confirm whether the problem lies in how feedback is being added to self.feedback.

Probable Issue
Incorrect Feedback Accumulation:
The line self.feedback[var].append(word_feedback) in update_constraints appends all feedback for every guess to the variableâ€™s feedback list.
Over time, self.feedback[var] accumulates feedback from multiple guesses, resulting in a list that is too long.
Fix: Store Feedback Correctly
Instead of appending new feedback to the list, replace the feedback for each variable during each update. Modify update_constraints:

python
Copy code
def update_constraints(self, feedback):
    for var, word_feedback in zip(self.variables, feedback):
        # Replace the feedback for the variable with the current feedback
        self.feedback[var] = word_feedback  # Replace instead of append
        print(f"DEBUG: Updated feedback for {var}: {self.feedback[var]}")
    self.enforce_node_consistency()
    self.enforce_arc_consistency()
This ensures that self.feedback[var] only contains the most recent feedback for that variable.

Why This Fix Works
Feedback for a word should only correspond to the latest guess for that word.
By replacing feedback instead of appending, you ensure self.feedback[var] remains a flat list of 5 tuples, matching the length of the word.
Testing the Fix
Run the game again and verify:

self.feedback[y] is a list of 5 tuples, not a longer concatenated list.
The error no longer occurs.
If the issue persists:

Share the debug output from the modified enforce_arc_consistency and update_constraints. This will help trace where the feedback becomes malformed.
